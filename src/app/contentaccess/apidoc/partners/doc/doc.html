                    <p>A partner is a scientific data or informatics system that makes up a unit for subscription,
                        authentication, and authorization. The partner offers its resources through a well-defined set of URIs.
                        Each partner has a set of regular expressions that identifies these base URIs. Partners have individual
                        subscription terms for display on subscription pages. Terms have period, price, and group discount
                        percentage. Partners have access rules that identify sets of URIs with regular expressions that are Paid
                        resources or Login-Required Resources. A Paid resource requires a subscription. A Login-Required resource
                        requires the user to log in, usually because the resource needs the user's identity for attribution for some
                        reason. Note that individual subscriptions use login to authenticate for access to Paid resources, but this
                        is independent of rules requiring login to access resources. Login-Required resources can be Paid resources
                        as well.</p>
